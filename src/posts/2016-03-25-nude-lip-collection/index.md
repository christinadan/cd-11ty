For anyone interested in makeup trends, nude lips have been SUPER trendy, and I have to admit, I'm in love with it. Nude-y lips are so easy to wear and they go with almost any makeup look. They even add a sort of edginess to a look without the hassle of a darker, more vampy color. Wearing a nude lip is effortless and hassle-free glam, which is something I can definitely get on board with.<!-- excerpt -->

Like any person with even a slight interest in makeup, I have a bad buying habit. Although I don't think it's as bad as some, I end up owning a lot of similar products. Unlike foundations and even eye makeup, I tend to avoid buying lip products unless they're inexpensive and/or from the drugstore. I quite frankly can't justify paying $20+ for one lipstick. I like having the variety of options without paying the price tag. That isn't to say I won't splurge sometimes, but I'm a huge fan of the ever popular (and affordable) NYX or Colourpop lip products.

I've decided to show my small collection in case anyone else is interested in hoarding nude lip products like me. :-) As far as what one would consider a "nude", I just take it as a color that could be someone's lip color...but better. Personally, my lips are a very neutral pink-brown color, so they're a bit dark, but I know other people have lighter lips. With that being said, some of these colors can be a little too light to be actual nude on me, but you get the idea.

## Liquid Lipsticks

{% responsiveImage 'nude-liquid-lipsticks.jpg', 'Liquid lipstick swatches' %}

**[NYX Xtreme Lip Cream](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4141619)** - I actually HATE the formula of this product (or maybe it's just the color I have). But it doesn't go on smoothly for me and is very chunky. Not a true liquid lipstick in the sense that it's not really matte at all.

- Nude Peach Fuzz

**[NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod3020045)** - Super comfortable to wear. Again, not really a true liquid lipstick, but I like the color payoff enough and it doesn't leave my lips dry.

- Stockholm
- Cannes
- Adu Dhabi

**[NYX Liquid Suede](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod12911001&_requestid=303440)** - LOVE this product. Very comfortable to wear. Not SUPER transfer-proof, but more matte than the Soft Matte Lip Cream.

- Soft-spoken

**[Colourpop Ultra Satin Lips](https://colourpop.com/product-category/lips/ultra-satin-lip/)** - They recently released this range; the name explains what it is. Comfortable to wear.

- Echo Park - Love this color, but the color kind of washes me out alone. I wear it over a darker lipliner.

**[Colourpop Ultra Matte Lips](https://colourpop.com/product-category/lips/ultra-matte-lip/)** - Super dry matte lip. Pretty much transfer proof. Just be sure to exfoliate the crap out of your lips.

- Beeper

## Lipsticks

**[MAC](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/mac-lipstick/3022868?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&contextualcategoryid=0&fashionColor=&resultback=404)** - They have different finishes. Quality is great, obviously, but a bit more pricey.

- Shanghai Spice - This is sheer and has shimmer. Not a huge fan tbh.
- Faux

**[Milani](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/milani-color-statement-lipstick/ID=prod6178634-product)** - I LOVE these, and they're very nice to apply and wear.

- Matte Beauty - As you can tell by the name, this has a matte finish. Still super creamy at the same time. I love the orangey brown.
- Teddy Bare - Lovely creamy brown

**[Colourpop Lippie Stix](https://colourpop.com/product-category/lips/lippie-stix/)** - You've probably heard tons about these, so I won't say too much. But love the shade variety and finish!

- Aquarius - From the Kathleen Lights collab; I'm not a huge fan because it's a little too light for me, but looks fine with certain lipliners.
- Brink

**[Maybelline Creamy Matte](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod11351217)** - Very soft and comfortable to wear! I want to pick up some more shades.

- Clay Crush - Probably one of my favorite shades. It's so flattering!

**[Kat Von D Studded Kiss](http://www.sephora.com/studded-kiss-lipstick-P387435)** - This is only a sample, but I actually quite like it.

- Lovecraft - I like that it's slightly purple. Looks cool with my purple hair!

**[Nars Satin Lip](http://www.sephora.com/satin-lip-pencil-P378859)** - Another sample. You know those Nars lip duos you get for your birthday from Sephora? I have like 4 of them.

- Rikugien

## Lipliners
{% responsiveImage 'nude-lipliners.jpg', 'Nude lipliner swatches' %}

**[Colourpop Lippie Pencil](https://colourpop.com/product-category/lips/lippie-pencils/)** - I'd say these are actually some of my favorite lip products in general. I like the colors more than the Lippie Stix. Creamy, but not shiny, and easy to apply.

- Bound - One of my FAVORITE shades. It's a very nice gray mauvey color. Interestingly, the actual Lippie Stix version of this isn't the same color.
- Brink
- Mayezor - From ItsMyRayeRaye's collab. Actually pretty close to Bound, but a little cooler in tone.
- Aquarius

**[NYX Slim Lip Pencil](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod2150078)** - I only own one of these, but I hate it! It's very stiff and hard to draw with. I feel like I have to put on a lot of pressure to get any color payoff.

- Mauve - I like this color, however

**[Charlotte Tilbury Lip Cheat](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/charlotte-tilbury-lip-cheat-re-size-re-shape-lip-liner/3866460)** - One of the only high end lip products I actually bought. It's nice. Not sure how much better it is than Colourpop tbh. Very highly talked about product.

- Iconic Nude - I went to the Charlotte Tilbury counter at Nordstrom and asked for a nude, but I felt that Pillowtalk was too light for me, so they gave me this.

I hope you all enjoyed these swatches! I know my collection will keep growing. I have my eye on MAC Whirl and Velvet Teddy...of course. And NYX Lip Lingerie, which I've yet to try out!
