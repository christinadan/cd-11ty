If you're familiar with what's going on in the beauty world, peachy eyeshadow has been totally on trend. The color is perfect for spring and summer. You may have also seen the hype behind Too Faced's Sweet Peach Palette, particularly because of the fact that is was limited edition (supposedly).<!-- excerpt --> I debated back and forth for a while, and by the time I decided whether or not I wanted to get it, it was sold out everywhere. I was a little disappointed at first, but after hearing about all the shady transactions from Ulta/Sephora stores (like selling the palettes before they were actually supposed to be released), it kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. I even read somewhere that this was intentional marketing done by Too Faced to create hype around their product JUST so they can sell more when they make it a part of their permanent collection (which a lot of people seem to suggest).

Anyway, after not being able to get my hands on that palette, I came across a post on Reddit where someone suggested a dupe for the Sweet Peach Palette - for just $10! After looking at the colors in the palette, I decided to pick it up from Ulta.

Introducing the [Makeup Revolution New-trals vs. Neutrals](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod13661069) palette!

Makeup Revolution is a fairly new brand to Ulta. I've heard rave reviews of some of their other products from KathleenLights and Tati from GlamLifeGuru on YouTube, so it gave me a little more confidence in buying it. Plus, for $10, I didn't feel that I would be losing that much money if it turned out to be a bust.

Here are the two palettes side-by-side:

The Makeup Revolution palette has 16 colors, while the Too Faced one has 18. There are the peachy colors, as well as shimmery champagne colors. There are purples, as well! The Too Faced palette has a green shade and a shimmery black, but overall, the two palettes have the same feel.

Here are the swatches I was able to do (colors are in order according to the palette):

The palette comes with a dual-end brush. It isn't great, but it's not one of those foam ones. I will say that the quality overall probably isn't as niceÂ as the Too Faced palette, at least just from swatches (I haven't worn these yet). I don't actually own any of Too Faced's eyeshadows, so this is just an assumption. Also, my skin is tanner than most of the other swatch-ers I've seen, so the color isn't as vibrant. Some of the matte shades are a tad bit chalky.

With all this being said, I actually really like the shimmery shades. I thought they were creamy and the color payoff was decent. Luckily, the shades I was interested in - mainly the peach ones at the top - are really nice! I have other eyeshadow palettes that fill in the gaps where the chalki-er matte ones fall short, so I'm really glad I got this palette.
