I consider myself the type of person that wears makeup out of necessity.  I usually stick to neutral eye looks for work, if I even decide to wear eyeshadow at all. I feel like I really have to try if I want to try something more colorful. If you read my [Korea and Japan Beauty Haul](http://christinadan.com/korea-and-japan-beauty-haul/) post, you might've seen that I picked up a couple of colorful shadows in Korea. I finally decided to put them to use this past Friday!

As someone who enjoys looking at makeup tutorials more than actually doing them a lot of the time, I thought I'd share what I used for my look. As someone with severely hooded monolids, it can be hard finding resources for that unique eyeshape. Couple that having slightly-darker-than-medium skintone and trying to find Korean face makeup with a shade that matches, you end up doing a lot of trial and error. I personally love reading what makeup other people use, especially if the person is someone who has similar facial features. Even if we don't have similar features - I hope it's still mildly interesting. :-)

I used a lot of the Japanese and Korean makeup products I own for this look - though my collection is far from complete. Like I mentioned, I've been dying to try a Korean cushion foundation, but there are so few brands that carry any shades that would match my skintone. I know there are a few out there, but finding them in the US can be quite hard.

Following the theme of quick and easy to take on-the-go foundation, I decided to try the new **Hourglass Vanish Seamless Finish Foundation Stick** after hearing good things about it on Youtube. Let me just say that I seldom return makeup products. I usually put a lot of time researching what I buy and it mostly works out for me. With that being said, I had to return it after testing it out for a week. I'm not sure if it was my skin type (dehydrated combination skin - mostly just a little oily in the forehead, dry cheeks), but it didn't blend as well as I would've liked. It started separating on my nose almost immediately. The foundation also wasn't as full-coverage as I thought despite its claims. It was a total bummer, because the shade 'Golden' was a perfect match. Interesting note to add, too: when I was at Sephora returning the foundation, the cashier mentioned that a lot of other people were returning it for the same reason. Guess I'm not the only one!

Anyway, the mini foundation review wasn't intended, but I felt like I really needed to say it anyway. Here are the sources for the products I used in my peachy orange makeup look! Maybe one day I'll feel comfortable or good enough to do a tutorial. In the meantime, you all get a list of products. :P

Close up of the eyes - if you think my eyeliner is uneven, you'd be right. Not only are my eyes monolids and hooded, they are also uneven. The left eye is more folded, so you see less lid space when they're open, meaning I have the draw the liner thicker for it to appear even.

And here is the outfit I wore with the look:

The top is from Style Nanda - can we talk about how this was pretty much the only shirt that fit me because their store is one size fits all i.e. it's probably not gonna fit me unless it's stretchy? Shorts are from Target, shoes are Steve Madden!
