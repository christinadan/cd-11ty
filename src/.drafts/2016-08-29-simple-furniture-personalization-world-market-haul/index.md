Moving into a new place always gets me excited for when I get to decorate and pick out furniture. Although we moved in 2 months ago, we finally get to _live_ in our new home! Even so, it's far from being complete (is it ever though?). There's a laundry list of things we still need to get and we haven't even hung up any of our art yet.Â With that being said, we did get some new furnishings in this past week! Cost Plus World Market was having a 20% off + free shipping sale, which they always seem to have, and we pounced on the chance to get some of the things we've been eyeballing.

For months, I was lusting over the [white midcentury nightstands from West Elm](http://www.westelm.com/products/545731/?kwid=productads-adid%5E47300713553-device%5Ec-plaid%5E84798008513-sku%5E545731-adType%5EPLA&gclid=CjwKEAjwl4q-BRDtzJmSk-uGunkSJACmCOY-HbSduY6MgfIF2WelvG9wAS_Z2k4VwN9zmEUQww69qRoCehTw_wcB&cm_ite=AllProducts&cm_pla=Nightstands&cm_cat=Shopping&catalogId=71&bnrid=3902401&sku=545731&cm_ven=Google_PLA), but I couldn't justify the $299 price tag for just one. That's why I was beyond excited when I found [these](http://www.worldmarket.com/product/white+mid+century+nightstand.do) from World Market! For just $129 each (plus that awesome sale), it was perfect for the theme I was going for in our bedroom. Although they aren't exactly the same, I actually prefer the small and lower profile of the World Market one.

Anyone who knows me knows I'm not good at DIYs AT ALL. With that being said, I did want to customize the nightstands a bit, so I exchanged the existing knobs with the [Streamline Knob from Anthropologie](http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/home-hardware-knobs/26731984.jsp#/). At just $6 each, they were the perfect added touch.

The other purchase we made from World Market was this [Gold Rolling Bar Cart](http://www.worldmarket.com/product/gold+cole+3-tier+rolling+bar+cart.do). I have to shamefully say we are not big drinkers and aside from some beer in the fridge, we don't really buy liquor or alcohol. So why would we need a bar cart? While browsing [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/christinadotpng/) (shameless plug, I mostly use it for ideas for the apartment), I saw this great idea to make a coffee cart! Stephen is a huge coffee aficionado and we needed more room in our cabinets for our mug collection. So we decided to move most of his coffee gear to the cart. It turned out pretty cool, if I do say so myself!

The petite size was perfect for the little wall in our galley kitchen.
