  In her downtime, Christina is a food hobbyist; she can often be found in her kitchen cooking food or baking bread (sourdough or otherwise!), along with making the occasional dessert. She also enjoys dining and trying restaurants wherever she goes. Her other pastimes include vegetable gardening, home improvement, skateboarding, and traveling when there's not a global pandemic. She and her partner are proud parents of a rescue pug and cat.
